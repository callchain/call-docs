# Concepts

Learn the "what" and "why" behind fundamental aspects of the CALL Ledger.

## Introduction

The CALL Ledger is a decentralized cryptographic ledger powered by a network of peer-to-peer calld servers. This section covers basic concepts that help you learn the "what" and "why" behind fundamental aspects of the CALL Ledger.

## System Basics

One of the primary purposes of the CALL Ledger is payment processing. Learn more about key concepts that will help you understand the CALL Ledger payment system.

## Payment Types

The CALL Ledger supports point-to-point CALL payments alongside other, more specialized payment types.

## Issued Currencies

All currencies other than CALL can be represented in the CALL Ledger as issued currencies. Learn more about how issued currencies function in the CALL Ledger.

## Decentralized Exchange

The CALL Ledger contains a fully-functional exchange where users can trade issued currencies for CALL or each other.

## Consensus Network

The CALL Ledger uses a consensus algorithm to resolve the double spend problem and choose which transactions to execute in which order. Consensus also governs rules of transaction processing.

## The calld Server

calld is the core peer-to-peer server that manages the CALL Ledger. This section covers concepts that help you learn the "what" and "why" behind fundamental aspects of the calld server.
